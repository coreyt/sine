# Sine: Software Architecture Pattern Detector

**Sine is not ESLint** - it's a next-generation architectural compliance and pattern discovery tool.

Sine enforces high-level architectural decisions (e.g., "All HTTP calls must use a circuit breaker") rather than low-level code style.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install sine
sine init
sine check
```
