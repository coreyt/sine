## Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Sine**. In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted
with contributions from any person or entity, **Sine** must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that 
has been signed by each contributor.

### 1. Definitions

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this
Agreement. "Contribution" shall mean any source code, documentation, or other materials submitted by You for inclusion 
in the Project.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to **Sine** a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, **sublicense**, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to **Sine** a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license 
applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s).

### 4. Ownership and Rights

You acknowledge that **Sine** may license the Project (including Your Contributions) under the **Elastic License v2 (ELv2)** 
or any other license, including commercial proprietary licenses, at its sole discretion. You retain ownership 
of the copyright in Your Contribution; this agreement simply grants the Project the rights needed to manage 
and commercialize the software.

### 5. Representing That You Are the Owner

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer has rights to 
intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received 
permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer.

> "By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the terms of the 
Project's CLA CONTRIBUTING.md and the Elastic License v2."
