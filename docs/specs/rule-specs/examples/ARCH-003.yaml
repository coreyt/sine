  title: "Use logging instead of print statements"
  description: |
    Production code should use proper logging (Click.echo or logging module)
    instead of print() statements for better control and formatting.
  rationale: |
    Print statements bypass structured logging and can't be filtered by log level.
    Click.echo() respects output redirection and encoding.
