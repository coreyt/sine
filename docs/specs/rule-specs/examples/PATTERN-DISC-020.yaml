  title: "Type Alias Pattern"
  description: |
    Discovers usage of type aliases for creating semantic type names that improve
    code readability and maintainability.
  rationale: |
    Type aliases provide semantic names for complex types, making code more self-documenting
    and easier to refactor. Commonly used for union types, generic types, and domain concepts.
