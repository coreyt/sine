# Lookout User Guide

## Overview

Lookout is a Governance-as-Code platform that enforces architectural decisions using Semgrep rules. It has two main interfaces:

- **`lookout` CLI** — enforce patterns, discover patterns, validate, and promote
- **`lookout-tui`** — terminal UI for browsing patterns and generating new ones via LLM

## Installation

```bash
# Core package
pip install -e .

# TUI package (from repo root)
cd tui && pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Part 1: Lookout CLI

### Initialize a Project

```bash
lookout init
```

This creates a `lookout.toml` (or adds `[tool.lookout]` to `pyproject.toml`) and optionally sets up a `.lookout-patterns` directory for user-defined patterns.

### Check Your Codebase

```bash
# Run all built-in and user patterns
lookout check

# Target specific directories
lookout check src/ tests/

# Output as SARIF for CI integration
lookout check --format sarif > results.sarif
```

Lookout ships with 10 built-in patterns that work without any configuration. User patterns in `.lookout-patterns/` override built-in patterns with the same ID.

### Discover Patterns

```bash
# Discover architectural patterns in your code
lookout discover

# Research patterns from web sources
lookout research --focus "circuit breaker"

# Research without LLM (keyword extraction only)
lookout research --focus "dependency injection" --no-llm

# Derive patterns from your project's architecture docs
lookout research --focus "architectural patterns" --docs .
```

### Validate and Promote

```bash
# Mark a discovered pattern as reviewed
lookout validate PATTERN-ID

# Promote to an enforcement rule
lookout promote PATTERN-ID

# Promote with LLM-generated Semgrep rule
lookout promote PATTERN-ID --generate-check
```

### Configuration

Lookout reads configuration from `lookout.toml` or `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.lookout]
rules_dir = ".lookout-rules"
patterns_dir = ".lookout-patterns"
target = ["src"]
format = "text"
```

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the full reference.

## Part 2: Lookout TUI

The TUI provides a visual interface for browsing patterns and generating new pattern specifications using a three-stage LLM pipeline.

### Launch

```bash
lookout-tui
```

Or via module invocation:

```bash
python -m lookout_tui
```

### Global Key Bindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `b` | Switch to Pattern Browser screen |
| `g` | Switch to Generation Pipeline screen |
| `q` | Quit |

### Pattern Browser

The browser screen shows all built-in and user patterns in a filterable table with a detail panel.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Lookout > Pattern Browser          10 patterns    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Filter: [________]                                |
+----------------------------+---------------------+
| ID       | Title     |Tier | Detail Panel         |
|----------|-----------|-----|                      |
| ARCH-001 | HTTP Res..| 1   | ARCH-001             |
| ARCH-003 | Use Logg..| 1   | HTTP Calls Require   |
| DI-001   | Dep Inj...| 2   | Resilience Wrappers  |
| LAYER-001| Layer Bo..| 2   |                      |
| REPO-001 | Repo Pat..| 2   | Category: resilience |
| ...      |           |     | Severity: error      |
|          |           |     | Languages: python    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| [/]filter [r]efresh [1-3]tier [Esc]back          |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**Browser key bindings:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Focus the filter input |
| `r` | Rebuild the pattern index |
| `1` | Show Tier 1 patterns only |
| `2` | Show Tier 2 patterns only |
| `3` | Show Tier 3 patterns only |
| `0` | Show all tiers |
| `j/k` | Navigate rows |
| `Esc` | Go back |

The filter searches across pattern ID, title, category, and tags. The detail panel updates as you navigate rows, showing the full metadata for the selected pattern.

### Generation Pipeline

The generation screen runs a three-stage LLM pipeline to produce new pattern specifications. It connects to an Airlock proxy (OpenAI-compatible endpoint) that forwards requests to a backing LLM.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Lookout > Generation Pipeline                     |
+--------------------+-----------------------------+
| Job Queue          | Pipeline: CQRS-001          |
|                    |                             |
| CQRS-001 [stg 1]  | * top_level: approved       |
| EVENT-001 [pend]   | o language_generic: running  |
|                    | o language_framework: pending|
|                    |-----------------------------|
|                    | Stage: language_generic      |
|                    | Status: awaiting_review      |
|                    | -------------------------    |
|                    |                             |
|                    | [LLM output here...]        |
|                    |                             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| [n]ew [a]pprove [r]eject [t]retry [w]rite [Esc]  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**Generation key bindings:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | Create a new generation job |
| `t` | Run/retry the current stage |
| `a` | Approve the current stage output |
| `r` | Reject the current stage output |
| `w` | Write compiled output to the diff view |
| `Esc` | Go back |

### Generating a New Pattern

This is the core workflow for creating new pattern specifications.

#### Step 1: Create a Job

Press `n` to create a new generation job. The job starts with a placeholder ID (`NEW-001`) and `python` as the default target language. The pipeline creates stages based on the job's target languages and frameworks.

#### Step 2: Run Stage 1 — Top-Level Specification

Press `t` to run the first stage. The system sends two prompts to the LLM:

- **System prompt** (`docs/prompts/system-prompt-pattern-research.md`): establishes the LLM as a static analysis pattern expert with strict quality standards for Semgrep rules, code examples, and references
- **User prompt** (`docs/prompts/user-prompt-top-level.md`): asks for the language-agnostic pattern specification

The LLM produces Section 1 of the pattern spec:
- Identity: ID, title, category, subcategory, tags, tier, severity, confidence
- Description: what the pattern enforces and why
- Detection strategy: what structural signal makes static detection possible
- False positive/negative analysis
- Reference URLs
- Target language relevance table

The output appears in the diff view for review.

#### Step 3: Review and Approve

Read the LLM output in the diff view. You have three options:

- **`a` (Approve)**: Lock in this stage. The approved text becomes input for the next stage. Stage 2 auto-starts immediately.
- **`r` (Reject)**: Mark the output as rejected. Press `t` to retry — the LLM is called again from scratch.
- **`t` (Retry)**: Re-run any rejected or errored stage.

#### Step 4: Stage 2 — Language-Generic Variant (auto-starts)

After approving Stage 1, Stage 2 runs automatically. The prompt (`docs/prompts/user-prompt-language-generic.md`) receives the full approved Stage 1 output as context, plus the target language. It asks for:

- A concrete Semgrep rule using the target language's actual syntax
- Check type selection (forbidden, must_wrap, required_with, raw, or pattern_discovery)
- Good example code that follows the pattern (must NOT match the rule)
- Bad example code that violates the pattern (MUST match the rule)
- Language-specific notes
- Rule ID convention: `{pattern-id}-{language}-impl`

Review and approve/reject as before.

#### Step 5: Stage 3 — Language-Framework Variant (if configured)

If the job has target frameworks, Stage 3 runs after Stage 2 approval. The prompt (`docs/prompts/user-prompt-language-framework.md`) receives both approved outputs and asks the LLM to either:

- **Justify a framework-specific variant** — explain why the generic pattern is insufficient for this framework, then provide a more specific Semgrep rule
- **Declare SKIP** — if the generic pattern already covers the framework adequately

Framework variants should only exist when the framework's base classes, decorators, or conventions genuinely change the detection approach. Rule ID convention: `{pattern-id}-{language}-{framework}-impl`.

#### Step 6: Write Output

Press `w` to assemble all approved stage outputs into a single document shown in the diff view. This is the research artifact — the structured output from all three stages combined as Markdown.

### Stage State Machine

Stages follow this lifecycle:

```
PENDING --[t]--> RUNNING --[success]--> AWAITING_REVIEW --[a]--> APPROVED
                    |                         |
                    v                         v
                  ERROR                   REJECTED
                    |                         |
                    +----------[t]------------+--> PENDING (reset)
```

- **Auto-advance**: Approving a stage automatically starts the next pending stage
- **Prerequisites**: A language stage requires an approved top-level. A framework stage requires both an approved top-level and an approved language stage for the same language.
- **Retry**: Press `t` to retry any rejected or errored stage. The pipeline finds the first failed stage and re-runs it.

### Airlock Configuration

The TUI connects to an Airlock LLM proxy — an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that forwards to a backing model. Default settings (configured via `TUIConfig`):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `airlock_endpoint` | `http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions` | Airlock proxy URL |
| `airlock_model` | `gemini-3.1-pro` | Model name sent in requests |
| `airlock_api_key` | (empty) | Bearer token for auth |
| `airlock_temperature` | `0.3` | LLM temperature |
| `airlock_max_tokens` | `4096` | Max response tokens |
| `airlock_timeout` | `120.0` | HTTP timeout in seconds |
| `prompts_dir` | `docs/prompts` | Directory containing prompt templates |
| `index_path` | `.lookout-index.json` | Pattern index output path |
| `patterns_dir` | `.lookout-patterns` | User patterns directory |

The client retries automatically on HTTP 429, 500, 502, and 503 with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts).

## Pattern Schema Versions

Lookout supports two YAML schema versions:

### v1 — Flat Rule Spec

Single-language, flat structure. Used by the original enforcement rules.

```yaml
schema_version: 1
rule:
  id: ARCH-001
  title: HTTP Calls Require Resilience Wrappers
  description: ...
  rationale: ...
  tier: 1
  category: resilience
  severity: error
  languages: [python]
  check:
    type: must_wrap
    target: [requests.get, requests.post]
    wrapper: [circuit_breaker, with_retry]
  reporting:
    default_message: HTTP call missing resilience wrapper
    confidence: high
  examples:
    good: [{ language: python, code: "..." }]
    bad: [{ language: python, code: "..." }]
  references: [https://...]
```

### v2 — Hierarchical Pattern Spec

Multi-language, with per-language and per-framework variants. This is the target output of the generation pipeline.

```yaml
schema_version: 2
pattern:
  id: DI-001
  title: Dependency Injection via Constructor
  description: ...
  rationale: ...
  version: "1.0.0"
  tier: 2
  category: architecture
  subcategory: dependency-injection
  severity: warning
  tags: [solid, testability]
  reporting:
    default_message: Use constructor injection for dependencies
    confidence: medium
  references: [https://...]
  variants:
    - language: python
      version_constraint: ">=3.10"
      generic:
        check:
          type: raw
          config: |
            rules:
              - id: di-001-python-impl
                pattern: ...
                languages: [python]
                severity: WARNING
                message: ...
          engine: semgrep
        examples:
          good: [{ language: python, code: "..." }]
          bad: [{ language: python, code: "..." }]
      frameworks:
        - name: django
          check:
            type: raw
            config: ...
            engine: semgrep
          examples:
            good: [{ language: python, code: "..." }]
            bad: [{ language: python, code: "..." }]
    - language: typescript
      generic:
        check:
          type: pattern_discovery
          patterns: ["class $C { constructor($DEPS) { ... } }"]
        examples:
          good: []
          bad: []
```

The three-stage generation pipeline maps directly to this structure:
- **Stage 1** produces the `pattern:` metadata fields (id, title, description, tier, detection strategy, etc.)
- **Stage 2** produces a `variants[].generic` entry for each language
- **Stage 3** produces `variants[].frameworks[]` entries where justified

### Check Types

Patterns use one of five check types, from simplest to most powerful:

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| `forbidden` | Flag a single pattern that should never appear | `print(...)`, `eval($X)` |
| `must_wrap` | Call X must appear inside wrapper Y | HTTP calls inside circuit breaker |
| `required_with` | If pattern A exists, pattern B must also exist | `@route` requires `@auth` |
| `raw` | Complex multi-pattern Semgrep rules | `pattern-either`, `pattern-not-inside`, etc. |
| `pattern_discovery` | Find instances without judging (informational) | Architectural inventory |
